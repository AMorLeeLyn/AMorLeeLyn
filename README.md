- 👋 Hi, I’m Amanda but I sometimes go by Alynn (Lynn = my middle name 😉)
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and UX Design. My goal is break into the educational technology space. I've always been interested in language acquisition in particular and would love to make the process of gaining fluency more achieavebe by improving upon current study tools or deleveloping new ones.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS, HTML and JavaScript. I've dabbled in C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that focus on optimizing user experience. Particularly with apps or websites that are primarily used as an educational tool, usability and accessibilty are extremely important. I've always believed it a necessity for developers to think beyond functionality. I'm here as a tester, developer or thinker out of the boxer (I made that up 😁)
- 📫 How to reach me ... feel free to reach out to me on my Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanda-morton/ or Twitter @AmorLeeLynn.
